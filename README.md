# Space-traveller-project
The objective of project is to prepare a dashboard to study the data of 59 years of humans in space. I used power pivot, power query, pivot & map charts and tables.
Describing the dashboard, the graphics and icons are imported from excel whereas font is written using word-art. The access labels in crew count by destination chart allows to filter the dashboard by clicking on the items in slicers. The crude mission, people in space and human space charts gets filtered according to selected item. People in space chart shows the male and female values on either side of the horizontal axis. The map chart shows the number of space travelers since 1961 by country and another plot is flight by vehicle class.
Initially, 5 files were provided i.e., Crewed Mission (involved the launched and returned date of every vehicle including the destination, 330*10), Mission (involved the crewâ€™s name, spacecraft used, destination and space station visited, 1292*10), Space Travelers (details of space travelers including their gender country and continent, 570*5), Space Vehicles (includes details of different rockets, their total flights, their first launch date and class, 203*14) and Space Walks (different mission number, their durations, destination and dates, 830*12). Using power query files were loaded, data types were adjusted and connections were made between different files. Dashboard is prepared them using pivot tables, slicers and charts.
